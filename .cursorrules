# Project: Video Thumbnail Generator

## Goal
Generate a composite thumbnail image from a video file.

## Process
1. Decompose the video into individual frames.
2. Retain only one frame per second of the video duration; discard the rest.
3. Arrange the selected frames in a grid:
   - Each row contains 60 frames (one per second, representing one minute).
   - Each row represents one minute of video.
   - Multiple rows represent multiple minutes.
4. Output a single composite image with this layout.

## Input
- Video file (e.g., .mp4, .mov)

## Output
- Composite thumbnail image (e.g., .jpg, .png)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (OpenCV, Pillow, or ffmpeg as needed)

## Notes
- The script should be able to handle videos of arbitrary length and resolution, including very large files (e.g., several GB in size).
- Testing will include large files such as 2046.mp4 (4.1GB).
- Optionally, frames may be resized to fit within a reasonable thumbnail size.
- The output image should visually represent the timeline of the video, with time progressing left-to-right and top-to-bottom.
